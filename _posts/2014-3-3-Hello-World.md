Appropriately perhaps, this is an opening entry of many welcomes.

New York City has welcomed me with a warm autumnal embrace.
The exciting field of Data Science has welcomed me with genuine tough love.
The Metis family with it's universally fantastic Fall Cohort have all been most welcoming.

I'd now like to welcome you to my new worlds as I attempt to distil my experiences into readable snippets. Welcome!
